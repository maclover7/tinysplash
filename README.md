# Tinysplash

Tinysplash is a collection of free tools to help validate a business idea. Using
simple landing pages with "fake doors" and email collection will help tinysplash
users gauge the interest around their product idea while collecting the emails
of potential customers.

>A fake door is a convincing call-to-action that leads to no real feature or
>event. Itâ€™s a painless trick to gauge interest before committing any real
>resources.

## Future plans

* Adding simple a/b testing for price point validation
* A paid service to offer rewards to customers for referrals.
* Documentation and tips for running GoogleAds/FB adds

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

```bash
% ./bin/setup
```

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

```bash
% foreman start
```

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].
